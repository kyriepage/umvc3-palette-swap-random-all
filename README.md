Me and Six of ScanlineMedia.com needed a way to randomize character select in the Palette Swap mod of Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3. With the help of my older brother, we were able to make that vision come to fruition. 
The code is dead simple, but ideally very easy to use on a site like Trinket to be able to randomize all the characters and assists. 
If you have improvements or wanna make changes, be my guest. I am not a coder by trade, but I'd love to see this used elsewhere. 
Be sure to follow my big brother on bsky @danny.page, and you can follow my work at ScanlineMedia.com. 

To use this while you play the game, just remember that character teams are always selected in the order of Point, Shell, and Anchor. Just select the character the code generates, and the associated assist. That's it. 

Support the Pallate Swap and countless other characters by checking out https://www.nexusmods.com/ultimatemarvelvscapcom3/mods/12 or the Havengers Discord where they publish new characters all the time and release new builds. 

I will try to keep this code up to date when new characters get added to the stable builds of the game, but no promises. But to add a character, simply make a new line in the Character Directory in the following format:
  "Character Name": ["Assist 1", "Assist 2", "Assist 3"],

If you use this and wanna ban a character from being able to be selected, simply remove them from the character list. 

I think that covers most of it. Let me know if I need to change anything, but have fun playing UMVC3. :)

If you wanna see the code in action, go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U33plWARE6c to watch me and Six stream the game!
